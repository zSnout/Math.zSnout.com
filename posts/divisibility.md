# Divisibility Rules
It's rather obvious to tell when a number is divisible by 2 or 5, but are there other tricks?

## 2 - 10
Here are the divisibility rules for 2 to 10.

### 2
To check if a number is divisible by 2, check if it ends in `0`, `2`, `4`, `6`, or `8`. If it does, it's divisible by 2.
> `23896` is divisible by 2 because it ends in `6`.

### 3
To check if a number is divisible by 3, add up all the digits. If the new number is divisible by 3, your original number also was!
> `586` is not divisible by 3 because `19` (`5 + 8 + 6`) is not divisible by 3.

You can use this method recursively.
> `7248` --> `7 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 21`
>
> `21` --> `2 + 1 = 3`, which is divisible by 3, meaning that `7248` is also divisible by 3!

### 4
To check if a number is divisible by 4, check if the last two digits are divisible by 4. If they are, your original number is also divisible by 4.
> `568` is divisible by 4 because `68` is divisible by 4.

### 5
To check if a number is divisible by 5, check if it ends in `0` or `5`. If it does, it's divisible by 5.
> `582` is not divisible by 5 because it ends in `2`.

### 6
A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by [2](#2) and [3](#3).
> `67` is not divisible by 6 because it is not divisible by 2.

### 7
7 is to most complex number to check for divisibility by. While we go through the steps, we'll use `7389` as an example.

 1. Check if the number ends in a `0`. If it does, remove the `0` at the end. Our example number is still `7389`.
     - If it ends in several `0`s, you can remove all of them.
 2. Get the last digit of the number (`9`, in this case). Find a multiple of 7 ending in `9`. We found 49.
 3. Subtract this number from the original number. We now have `7340`.
 4. If this new number is a multiple of 7, your original number also was!
     - You can repeat this process with the new number.

> 1. `7389` doesn't end in a zero.
> 2. `7389 - 49` = `7340`
>     1. `7340` ends in a zero: `734`.
>     2. `734 - 14` = `720`
>         1. `720` ends in a zero: `72`.
>         2. `72 - 42` = `30`
>         3. `30` isn't a multiple of 7, so `720` isn't a multiple of 7.
>     3. `720` isn't a multiple of 7, so `7340` isn't a multiple of 7.
> 3. `7340` isn't a multiple of 7, so `7389` isn't a multiple of 7.

Done!

### 8
To check if a number is divisible by 8, check if the last 3 digits are divisible by 8. If they are, your original number is also divisible by 8.
> `1346` isn't divisible by 8 because `346` is not divisible by 8.

### 9
To check if a number is divisible by 9, add up all the digits. If the new number is divisible by 9, your original number also was!
> `2849` is not divisible by 9 because `23` (`2 + 8 + 4 + 9`) is not divisible by 9.

You can use this method recursively.
> `29403` --> `2 + 9 + 4 + 0 + 3 = 18`
>
> `18` --> `1 + 8 = 9`, which is divisible by 9, meaning that `29403` is also divisible by 9!

### 10
A number is divisible by 10 if it ends in a `0`.

## 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, etc.
Remember the process we used for checking if a number was divisible by 7? Guess what - you can use that process on any number that ends in `1`, `3`, `7`, and `9`! For example, let's check if `7944` is divisible by 13.

> 1. `9944` doesn't end in `0`.
> 2. `9944 - 104` (104 = 8 * 13) = `9840`
>     1. `9840` ends in `0`: `984`
>     2. `984 - 104` (104 = 8 * 13) = `880`
>         1. `880` ends in `0`: `88`
>         2. `88` is not divisible by 13, which means `880` isn't divisible by 13.
>     3. `880` is not divisible by 13, which means `9840` isn't divisible by 13.
> 3. `9840` is not divisible by 13, which means `9944` isn't divisible by 13.

## 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.
Did you notice how checking for divisibility by [2](#2), [4](#4), and [8](#8) were almost the same? We just took the last __ digits and tested them! We can do that with larger numbers too, specifically powers of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64...).

To test for divisibility by 2<sup>n</sup>, check if the last `n` digits are divisible by 2<sup>n</sup>.
> `83228` is divisible by 4 because `28` is divisible by 4.

## 5, 25, 125, 625, etc.
We can use the trick above on powers of 5 too!
> `48375` is divisible by 25 because `75` is divisible by 25.
