# Forcing Numbers
The [first article about guessing](guess-with-algebra) was pretty cool, but there are also ways to have somebody select more than one number, and end up at one result.

## Forcing 9
This method forces the number 9 on the audience.

 1. Ask each person to think of a six-digit number. For our example, we'll use `173924`.
 2. Ask each person to shuffle the digits in their number randomly, and to remember the result. We got `329471`.
 3. Ask each person to take the difference between their larger number and their smaller one. `329471 - 173924 = 1555`.
 4. Ask each person to add the digits in their number together, and to keep doing that until they have a one-digit number.
 5. Each member of the audience now has 9.
