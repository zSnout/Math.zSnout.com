# Forcing Numbers
The [first article about guessing](guess-with-algebra) was pretty cool, but there are also ways to have somebody select more than one number, and end up at one result.

## Forcing 9
This method forces the number 9 on the audience.

 1. Ask each person to think of a six-digit number. For our example, we'll use `173924`.
 2. Ask each person to shuffle the digits in their number randomly, and to remember the result. We got `329471`.
 3. Ask each person to take the difference between their larger number and their smaller one. `329471 - 173924 = 1555`.
 4. Ask each person to add the digits in their number together, and to keep doing that until they have a one-digit number.
 5. Each member of the audience now has 9.

## Forcing 1089
This method forces the number 1089 on the audience.

 1. Ask each person to think of a non-symmetrical three-digit number where the digits are decreasing. We'll use `932` as an example.
 2. Ask each person to reverse the digits in their number. We now have `239`.
 3. Ask each person to subtract their smaller number from the larger. We now have `693`.
 4. Ask each person to reverse the new number. We've got `396`.
 5. Ask each person to add the two numbers together. We've now got `693 + 396 = 1089`.
