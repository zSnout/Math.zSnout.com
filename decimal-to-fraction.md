To convert decimals to fractions, you should know the divisibility rules, which you can find [here](/divisibility). These are not required, but will help you simplify the fraction.

## Just Repeating
An example of a just repeating decimal is `0.575757...`.

 1. Identify the repeating part. For us, it's `57`.
 2. Identify how many digits are in the repeating part. For us, it's `2`.
 3. Create a number comprising of only `9`s with `x` digits, where `x` is the number you found in step 2. For us, it's `99`.
 4. Divide the number from step 1 by the number you created in step 3. For us, this is `57/99`.
 5. Simplify. For us, this is `19/33`.
