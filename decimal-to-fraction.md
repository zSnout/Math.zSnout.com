# Mentally Converting Decimals to Fractions
To convert decimals to fractions, you should know the divisibility rules, which you can find [here](/divisibility). These are not required, but will help you simplify the fraction.

## Repeating
An example of a repeating decimal is `0.575757...`.

 1. Identify the repeating part. We'll call it `r`. For us, `r = 57`.
 2. Identify how many digits are in the repeating part. We'll call it `a`. For us, `a = 2`.
 3. Create a number comprising of only `9`s with `a` digits. We'll call this `b`. For us, `b = 99`.
 4. Divide `r / b`. For us, this is `57/99`.
 5. Simplify. For us, this gives `19/33`.
 6. Done!

## Non-Repeating
An example of a non-repeating decimal is `0.125`.

 1. Identify how many digits there are in the decimal. We'll call this `a`. For us, it's `3`.
 2. Create a number starting with `1` and comprising of `a` `0`s. We'll call this `b`.
 3. Divide the original decimal by `b`. For us, this is `125/1000`.
 4. Simpify. For us, this gives `1/8`.
 5. Done!

## Combination
An example of a combination is `0.1666...`.

 1. Identify the non-repeating part. We'll call this `n`. For us, `n = 1`.
 2. Identify the repeating part. We'll call this `r`. For us, `r = 6`.
 3. Identify the number of digits in `n`. We'll call this `a`. For us, `a = 1`.
 4. Identify the number of digits in `r`. We'll call this `b`. For us, `b = 1`.
 5. Create a number starting with `1` and comprising of `a` `0`s. We'll call this `c`. For us, `c = 10`.
 6. Create a number comprising of `b` `9`s. We'll call this `d`. For us, `d = 9`.
 7. Create this fraction: `n / c`, and simplify it. We'll call this `x`. For us, `x = 1/10`.
 8. Create this fraction: `r / (d * c)`, and simplify it. We'll call this `y`. For us, `y = 6/90 = 1/15`.
 9. Add `x` to `y`. For us, this gives `25/150`.
   - Remember that `a/b + c/d = (a*d + b*c) / (b * d)`.
   - Also remember that `1/a + 1/b = (a + b) / (a * b)`.
 10. Simplify this fraction. For us, this is `25/150 = 1/6`.
