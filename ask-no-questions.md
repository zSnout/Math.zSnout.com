# Ask no Questions
In this article, you learn about ways to guess somebody's number without asking any questions.

## Method 1: Algebra
The first method is very simple.

### Preparing
 1. Select a one-digit number ranging from 2 to 6, and call it `a`. We'll use `a = 3`.
 2. Select another one-digit number ranging from 3 to 5, and call it `b`. We'll use `b = 4`.
 3. Multiply the two numbers together, and call the product `c`. For us, `c = 3×4 = 12`.

### The Trick
 1. Ask each person in the audience to select a small number from 1 to 100, but not to tell it to you. We'll use `7` as an example.
 2. Ask them to multiply their number by `a`. For us, `a = 3`, so we now have `7×3 = 21`.
 3. Ask them to add `c` to their number. For us, `c = 12`, so we now have `21+12 = 33`.
 4. Ask them to divide their number by `a`. For us, `a = 3`, so we now have `33÷3 = 11`.
 5. Ask each person to subtract their original number. We had `7`, so we now have `11-7 = 4`.
 6. Announce that you already knew their number! Say it was `b`, which it will be.
